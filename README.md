# Dynamic-Databases

#  TechStack
- React.JS -Frontend library used in the project.

# Features:
- Signup and login with google via authO
- option to create multiple tables
- There are 3 modules: column creation module, table entry module and table view module

 ### Column Creation Module - create columns here

- This would be a form with 2 fields - (i) column name and (ii) column type

- The column name is a text entry field and the column type is dropdown with 3 values - date, number, string, boolean  and multiselect

- If the user selects multiselect, there will be another text box that appears, where the user can enter the list of values that appears in the multiselect separated by commaâ€™s - E.g. chennai, delhi, mumbai

- The user can create multiple columns and click on submit

  ### Table entry module - create rows here

- The columns created above will be displayed in a table interface with the column names above as headers

  There will be 20 default rows to enter the values for the table(navigation is set between the cells, on pressing of the right arrow move towards the next cell and so on)

  The validations for column will depend on the column type - E.g. date column, we can only pick date, number column only enter number ,string column can string, boolean column   can pick only true or false and multiselect - can select only from the the list of values mentioned

- The user can fill multiple rows and then click on submit

 ### Table View module - view the table here

    The submitted rows above can be viewed in a datatable.
